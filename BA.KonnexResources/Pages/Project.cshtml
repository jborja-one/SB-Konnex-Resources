                        The past-producing copper, zinc, gold, and silver mine is located near Mackay, Idaho-- an area with a rich history in mining and exploration. The Empire underground mine was in operation between 1901 to 1942.

                    <li class="text-md py-4 pl-3">
                        Konnex is currently in the Feasibility Study stage to turn the brownfield site, located mostly on private land, into an oxide open pit mine to produce copper cathode, gold, silver, and zinc. We intend to build a responsible, low-carbon footprint operation to help support the growing need for the raw materials necessary to achieve the world’s clean energy goals.
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-md py-4 pl-3">
                        The process of extracting the materials will not include cyanides. Instead, we are proposing to use highly diluted sulfuric acid to retrieve copper and ammonium thiosulphate to retrieve gold. (note: need to add which process retrieves the other ore) These options are more environmentally friendly than cyanide and have proven to be more effective. In addition, the Project is situated on more than 2,000 feet of limestone above the nearest water source. This limestone acts like a natural basin that does not allow acid to pass through. Still, our team of environmental and mining engineers have done extensive research and testing to ensure our plans incorporate proper environmental protections.
