            <strong>Konnex Resources</strong> is committed to being a leader in modern mining practices by making
            environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and transparent governance (ESG) the foundation of
            everything we do. In June 2021, we established an ESG & Sustainability Committee. The role of the committee
            is to ensure the practices of Konnex Resources and its parent company, Phoenix Copper Limited, are meeting
            and exceeding the laws and regulations put in place to protect the natural resources and communities located
            in and around its mining operations.

                                living in the area. With this collaboration, we expect to welcome newcomers into a community

                                operation will have its own emergency and fire-fighting capabilities, and we are working with
                                community leaders to ensure proper emergency and law enforcement services are available to keep
                                up with population growth.
